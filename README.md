Instructions: Your group should upload one electronic copy of   your Excel   solution   on
Canvas   Canvas   (go   to   “Assignments”,   chose   the   appropriate   assignment   and   click   on   “submit” on   the   bar   on   the   right   hand   side   of   the   screen).      You   must   upload   your   solution no   later than   10   minutes before   the   start   of the   lecture   on   the   day   in which   they   are   due.   Ensure   your   solution   contains   your   cluster   and   each   group   member’s   name. You   should   submit   a   solution to   all “Assignment Questions”   . “Discussion   Questions”   are   designed   to   provoke thought and will be discussed in class but you do not need to address these in your   assignment. Your solution should be formatted and set out so that it   is   easy to   read,   clearly   show   your   working, the   logic   behind   your   answers, and   any   assumptions   you   made   in   the analysis. This assignment uses the same case text you read for lecture   8   (Clarkson   1).Keith Clarkson, sole owner and president of   the   Clarkson   Lumber   Company,   has   received   a      number      of      informal      inquiries      from      large,    nationally‐recognized      building      materials distributors about purchasing his company.   Although, Clarkson   relishes operating his own   business   he   would   be   interested   if   an   attractive   offer   were   received.   Unfortunately,   Mr.   Clarkson is unsure how much his company is worth so he turns to   you   for   guidance.Value Clarkson Lumber at December 31,   1995 assuming the firm will   obtain   a   credit   line   at   Northrup   National   Bank   sufficiently   large   to   take   advantage   of   discounts   on   purchases for   paying within   10 days of   invoice, thus increasing operating profit margins. With higher   mark‐ups   and continued operating   expense controls,   Clarkson projects   a   steady   operating   profit margin of   6% by 2000 after which he expects the sales growth rate to drop to a fairly   steady 7% per year. Margins and investment requirements will   also   stabilize   in   relation   to   sales growth. Make your forecasts using the “Projection Assumptions” in   the   table below.   The discount rate is   12.5%. Note that the   forecast ratios   already   include the   benefit   of   the   2% trade   discounts. For   simplicity, use   a tax   rate   of 35% throughout   the   projections,   i.e.,   disregard the tax schedule in note (c) to Exhibit   1.   All notes payable on Clarkson’s balance   sheet   are   interest‐bearing   liabilities.   Make   whatever   other   reasonable   assumptions   are   necessary to complete your analysis and explain the rationale   for   each.
Assignment Questions
1.       Project free cash flows for the next five years,   1996‐2000 and   estimate the   residual   value at the end of   year 5 using the perpetuity with growth formula. To project cash   flows   beyond 2000,   use the 7% sales growth rate and assume all other    FCF   components   will   maintain   the   same   ratios   you   used   for   the   year   of   2000.
2.       Value the entire company. What 代 写Clarkson Lumber Co – Part 2Java

3.       Using   your   valuation    for   Clarkson   at   the   end   of   1995,   compute   the   following   multiples:
a.       V(Operations)/Sales (based on estimated enterprise value). Compute this as   a forward multiple.
b.       V(Operations)/EBIT (based on estimated enterprise value). Compute this as   a forward multiple.
c.       In   principle, how   might   you   use   these   multiples   to   test   the   reasonableness of   your   valuation? What   other   data   would   you   need?
Discussion Questions (No submission needed)
As you are doing the analysis please consider the following   questions.
1.         What   is   the    effect   of   slower   growth   on   free   cash   flow?   What   about   increased operating margins?
2.       When will Clarkson start generating   a positive   free cash   flow?
3.       What is the Clarkson Lumber Company worth as   a going   concern?
